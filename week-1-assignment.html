<h3> About me</h3>
<p> I am a new student too the Web Development field and it's very exciting.</p>
<p> It's challenging and rewarding at the same time. What I would like to get out of this class, is to acquire the skills needed to get a full stack developer job. I can either work in the office or remote. If I learn another language, it would be cool to understand different websites in another language.</p>

<h3> Skills and interest</h3>
<p> Learning different languages, playing chess, watching basketball and football.</p>
<p> I would like to learn HTML, CSS and JV to name a few.</p>

<h3> Goals</h3>
