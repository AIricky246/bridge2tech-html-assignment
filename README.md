Week 1 - Homework Assignment

üìã Assignment Overview
Create a personal portfolio HTML page using only HTML (no CSS styling yet). This assignment will help you practice the fundamental HTML concepts and Git workflow we learned in class.

üéØ Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:

Practice writing semantic HTML5 structure
Use proper HTML elements and attributes
Follow the Git workflow for version control
Create content that represents your personal brand


üìù Requirements
HTML Structure Requirements
Your HTML page must include:

Proper HTML5 document structure

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> element with lang="en"
Complete <head> section with required meta tags
<body> element containing all visible content


Head Section Must Contain:
html<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Your Name - Portfolio</title>

Semantic HTML Elements (Use These):

<header> for the top section
<nav> for navigation (even if links don't work yet)
<main> for the primary content
<section> for different content areas
<footer> for bottom information


Required Content Sections:

Header: Your name as an <h1> and navigation placeholder
About Me: Introduction paragraph about yourself
Skills/Interests: List of your hobbies, interests, or skills you want to develop
Goals: What you hope to achieve in this course
Contact: Basic contact information
Footer: Copyright notice or additional info


Required HTML Elements to Practice:

At least 3 different heading levels (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>)
Multiple paragraphs (<p>)
At least one unordered list (<ul>) or ordered list (<ol>)
At least 2 links (<a>) - these can link to social media, GitHub, or be placeholders
At least one image (<img>) with proper alt attribute
Use <strong> or <em> for emphasis somewhere in your content




üìÅ File Requirements
Files to Create:

index.html - Your main HTML file
Create a folder structure like this:
your-portfolio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (your image files here)


Git Repository Requirements:

Initialize a Git repository in your project folder
Connect it to a new GitHub repository
Make at least 3 separate commits with descriptive messages
Push your final project to GitHub


üìã Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Fork and Clone This Repository
bash# After forking this repo on GitHub, clone it locally
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FORKED-REPO-NAME.git
cd FORKED-REPO-NAME

# Your HTML file should be created here
touch index.html
Step 2: Create Your HTML Structure
Start with this basic template and expand it:
html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name - Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Your Name Here</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#skills">Skills</a></li>
                <li><a href="#goals">Goals</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
        <!-- Add your content sections here -->
        
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- Add footer content here -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
Step 3: Git Workflow Practice
Make commits as you work:
bash# After creating basic structure
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add basic HTML structure and navigation"

# After adding content sections
git add .
git commit -m "Add about me and skills sections"

# After completing the page
git add .
git commit -m "Complete portfolio page with all required sections"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
